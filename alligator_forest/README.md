# Dev Folder
This folder is where you will be putting all of your modifications to the base project. Any packed scenes and assets you create should go here, and you are free to organize your files in this folder however you want. I also encourage you to change the name of the dev folder to make it easier for me to copy your files straight into the main project at the end of the jam.
