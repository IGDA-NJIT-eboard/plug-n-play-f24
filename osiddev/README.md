## Project Details
**Level Name**: The Trees

**Level Description**: Include a detailed description of the level and the mechanics included in the level
You spawn in a forest above a river. From the spawn you can see the end flag. To get to it, you must hop across
the branches, killing bugs by stomping on them along the way. However, theres a flock of birds preventing you
from reaching the flag. There are apples across the map that you must collect and deliver to the birds so that 
they move out of your way. You can descend from a branch by using the down input. Apples can be picked up and 
delivered simply by walking into the apples and then the birds.
