extends CharacterBody2D
## This Player class represents the basic player controller and builds off of 
## CharacterBody2D functionality. This class provides a variety of methods for you to be
## able to extend and override if you wanted to modify the player's functionality, as well as
## several quantities for you to tweak to change the feel of the player controller.
## DO NOT modify this script. Instead you should create a new script that extends the Player class
## if you want to create custom player functionality.

## The deceleration constant is used to slow the player down when there is no player input. I give this

@export var jump_strength: float = 20
## This is the player's gravitational constant in pixels/sec^2. The player will constantly be experiencing
## this downward acceleration when they are not grounded (default behavior). You can increase this 
## constant to increase the magnitude of the player's downward acceleration (make the player heavier).

## This function is called to check if the player is able to jump. By default this is true if the 
## player is grounded, but this function can be overridden to give the player controller unique jump
## behavior without modifying the player's _process function. For example, double jumping can be implemented
## by allowing the player to jump once in the air. A counter can be used to track how many times
## the player has jumped while not grounded, and this can return true when that counter is 0 (or some
## other arbitrary value depending on how many jumps the player is allowed before needing to land).
